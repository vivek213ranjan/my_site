Dependencies:


Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.
Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.
Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon).
Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.
Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses)
Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
